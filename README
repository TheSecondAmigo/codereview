p4 diff does not generate differences for newly added (via 'p4 add') files which have not yet
been committed. CodeStriker is an example code inspection tool which can benefit from this script.

This script (codereview.py) generates the diff output using "p4 diff" for modified files and unified 
diff ('diff -i') for newly added files
